        <h3> Common asked HR interview Questions</h3>


        <button class="accordion">Can you tell me a little about yourself?</button>
        <div class="panel"><i>
            <p>A formula I really like to use is called the Present-Past-Future formula. So, first you start with the present—where you are right now. Then, segue into the past—a little bit about the experiences you’ve had and the skills you gained at the previous position. Finally, finish with the future—why you are really excited for this particular opportunity.

<p>Let me give you an example:</p>

<p>If someone asked, “tell me about yourself,” you could say:</p>

<p><i>“Well, I’m currently an account executive at Smith, where I handle our top performing client.
 Before that, I worked at an agency where I was on three different major national healthcare brands.
 And while I really enjoyed the work that I did, I’d love the chance to dig in much deeper with one 
 specific healthcare company, which is why I’m so excited about this opportunity with Metro Health Center.”</></p>
     </i>   </div>

        <button class="accordion">How did you hear about the position?</button>
        <div class="panel">
           <p>In asking this question, interviewers are judging if you are an active or passive job seekers. Those who appear eager for the position may be perceived as more willing to put forth the needed effort to fulfill the position. Considering this, you want to be strategic in the way you answer this question.</p>
<h3 id="points-to-emphasize" class="inth3">Points to Emphasize </h3>
<p> Depending upon how you heard about the position, there are different ways that you can answer the question. Still, there are certain points to mention that can help you to properly answer such type of inquiry.</p>
<ul class="intul">
<li> Clearly state the source from which you heard of the position, but do not go into elaborate detail, other than the name of the individual, company or resource.</li>
<li> Explain what aspects drew you to the position. </li>
<li> Briefly state why you feel qualified for the job. </li>
<li> Express your excitement about the possibility of obtaining the position. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mistakes-you-should-avoid" class="inth3">Mistakes You Should Avoid </h3>
<p> Review these mistakes to avoid when answering this question.</p>
<ul class="intul">
<li> Even if you heard about the position from an employ, do not go into great detail about your relationship with that employee.</li>
<li> Do not give vague one word answers. </li>
<li> If you do not recall what job board you found the position through, do not dwell on that fact or make something up.</li>
<li> If you heard of a job from an employee who is on rocky terms with the company or recently departed on negative terms, do not mention their name.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sample-answer" class="inth3">Sample Answer</h3>
<p>One way to properly answer inquiries about how you heard about the position might be:</p>
<p>I heard about this position through a current employee, Jane Doe. She was a previous co-worker of mine at XYZ Company where I served as a project manager. After reviewing the position and researching the company, I felt qualified to fulfill the position and excited about the possibility of joining such a reputable company.</p>
<p>Remember, the question is asking more than just who sent you. Make sure that you address why you applied to the position and how you qualify. Addressing these things can help to avoid certain additional questions and possibly help you to secure the position.</p>

        <button class="accordion"> What do you know about the company?</button>
        <div class="panel">
           
			  <p>If you don’t seem like you know anything about them, you’ll come across as desperate – somebody who will take any job they can find. And that’s going to make you unattractive to any good employers out there.</p>

  <p>So when they ask, “what do you know about our company?”, your primary goal is to show you’ve done your research or knew about their company before applying. If you do this, you’ll be fine.</p>
        <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Do:</strong></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure to research the company before the interview (on their website, their LinkedIn page, and Google)</li>
<li>Understand what industry they&#8217;re in, what they sell and how they make money</li>
<li>Try to have some sense of their company size. Are they 100 employees? More than 10,000 employees?</li>
<li>In your answer, show you&#8217;ve done research and show that you&#8217;re excited about interviewing with their particular company</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Don&#8217;t:</strong></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Say you don&#8217;t know anything</li>
<li>Say facts that are incorrect or you aren&#8217;t sure about (it&#8217;s better to know one or two facts that you can say accurately, than five facts you&#8217;re not sure of)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Good answer examples:</h3>
<p><em>&#8220;From what I read, your company is one of the leaders in providing security software to other businesses. I read the list of clients on your website. Do you mostly serve Fortune 500 clients? I saw a couple big Fortune 500 companies mentioned on the list, including ___ and ___.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;You&#8217;re one of the largest investment banks in the US. Your headquarters is in Raleigh, NC, and you have 25,000 employees worldwide based on what I read on your website.&#8221;</em></p>

        <button class="accordion"> Why do you want this job?</button>
		<div class="panel">
		<p>Consider the job position and your background before customizing these answers.<br />
Keep in mind that you should try to construct an answer that will explain who you are and why you are there.<br />
Another good idea is to add a few words about the good/positive image of the company.<br />
<strong>Here are the answers:<br />

<p>13. The company’s good reputation and its successful strategies and values make everyone want to work for such a company.</p>
<p>14. This challenging job will allow me to utilize my ABC skills.</p>
<p>15. This company is known as a company that rewards employees who deliver good results.<br />

        <button class="accordion">Why should we hire you? </button>
        <div class="panel">
           <p>Try to talk about them and how you’ll help them. What will be better for them if they hire you? What will you improve for them?</p>
<p>And show you’ve done your research. Make it clear that you know what this position involves, and you’re ready to perform the tasks.</p>
<p><strong><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #339966;">Do:</span></span></b></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Be confident in your skills and abilities</li>
<li>Talk about specific things you can help them do or achieve if they hire you</li>
<li>Do your research before the interview and understand their needs, so you can “tailor” your answers and target the specific things they’ll need if they hire you in this role</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #993300;">Don’t:</span></span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Say “I don’t know”</li>
<li>Say “You should hire whoever you want”</li>
<li>Give a generic answer that’d fit any company. You really need to “tailor” this to the specific duties you’ll be performing in THIS specific job. Otherwise your answer will not impress them.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Good example answer:</h3>
<p><em>“I read on the job description that you’re looking for someone with experience in ____. I’ve done that for 3 years and can immediately help you accomplish ____”.</em>        </div>

        <button class="accordion"> What are your greatest professional strengths? </button>
        <div class="panel">
		<p>After all, the main reason interviewers ask this question is to identify if your strengths align with the needs of the company and the job's responsibilities. Your response will help the employer decide whether or not you are the strongest applicant for the position. That means if you're applying for an accounting job, it's not helpful to highlight your strength in event organization.</p>
         <div class="post-content">
		 
<p>In brief: “though employers are interested in hiring you as a person, they are concentrating on knowing your strengths – those things that you do well and enjoy doing.<br>
If you are applying for a position that requires X &amp; Y key skills in a specific area, you should speak in a job interview about your X &amp; Y strengths and tell how they apply to the job.”</p>
<p>So what are your greatest/major strengths?<br>
Remember, the interviewer wants to know more about you, especially to know more about your potential qualities to the job. Therefore, the more positive information you give, the stronger you position yourself in the final hiring decision.</p>
<p>Of course, you wouldn’t want to sound an obnoxious braggart, but to present your greatest strengths in a confident manner – those skills that are important for the job you’re applying for.</p>
<p><strong>Assess/identify your </strong><strong>greatest </strong><strong>strengths and relate them to the job requirements</strong><br>
One of the first steps you should take as a job candidate is to conduct self assessment. Self-assessment consists of evaluating your key skills, past achievements and professional experience.<br>
You must know what you are good at as a critical step toward being able to clearly communicate your greatest strengths to potential employers.<br>
You also want to read carefully the job-description to find out the key skills required for the job.</p>
<p><strong>Translate your greatest&nbsp; strengths into job-related language of benefits relevant to the job needs</strong><br>
For example: If you are good at presenting/speaking in front of a group, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">continue your case by telling </span>that it helps you in being a good salesman, influencing people or getting the action you desire from them. This answer is good for people applying for sales position or managerial ones.</p>
<h3>Answering – What is your greatest strength</h3>

<p>Here is an example of a good answer –</p>
<p>My education in [], my expe­rience in [] and my knowledge of the area of [] all will contribute to my performing this position with little or no downtime.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have the competent to adapt and learn in new work settings and cope with new work situations.</li>
<li>I have a great deal of energy, drive to success and initiative.</li>
<li>I like taking on new challenges</li>
<li>I like working/communicating with different type of people.</li>
<li>I’m creative and expressive writer and an orga­nized and fluent speaker.</li>
</ul><p>Respond with listing skill sets that are directly related to the job in question. Avoid personal characteristic strengths, such as values or attitudes.<br>
Instead, focus on those things you do well and are related to your area of expertise.</p>
<p>I have the proven ability to trans­fer my skills from one job to another. Because of this, I can learn my way around an orga­nization quickly. I can concentrate on motivating and managing the staff, while developing relationships with other employees and clients.</p>
<p>I can find the fastest, most efficient way to get the work done. As a result, I’m able to keep increasing my output while maintaining the quality.</p>

        <button class="accordion">  What do you consider to be your weaknesses </button>
        <div class="panel">
              <p>The first part of this question is realising that you actually have some (no, being a perfectionist doesn’t count).</p>
<p><em>Everyone </em>has weaknesses or things that they can improve about themselves. And being honest with yourself here&nbsp;will&nbsp;save you a lot of time in the long run.</p>
<p>The best answers to this question take one of your weaknesses, and then give practical examples of how you’re trying to address it. A good example of this type of answer would be:</p>
<p><em>‘I used to find it difficult to work on simultaneous projects, preferring to finish on one task before starting another. However, since taking a time management course recently, I’ve learnt how to manage my schedule more effectively, making it easier to multi-task when necessary’. </em></p>
<p><strong>Right answer: </strong>Weakness + how you’ve tried/are trying to address it = (eventually) strength</p>
<p><strong>Wrong answer: </strong>‘Kryptonite’</p>
